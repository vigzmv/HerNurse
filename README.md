## About
#### Mission

Mission is to encourage a healthy lifestyle by providing a one-stop 
solution to women for all kinds of health related issues, hassle free
answers to their health related questions and empowering them by
providing the portal where they can easily educate themselves.  

Health is the primary concern of most women as it ensures a good
lifestyle. Anyone who wants an answer can post a question anonymously and find 
answers which are provided by the users and the experts, or through the articles
published by credible users and experts in our discussion panel.

Apart from the infromation portal, we will be providing our users with 
predicted suggestions regarding their search tags, which expands our business
into the marketplace for various healthcare products, which is increasing roughly 
at 15-20% month on month.
